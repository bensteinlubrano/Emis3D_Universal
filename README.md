This was the main repository for Emis3D from 2023 to July 2025. Emis3D has since been refactored. The refactored version is located at github.com/ORNL-Fusion/Emis3D.

This is the core module of the Emis3D tokamak bolometry and radiation modeling code. Combine with a tokamak-specific module (Emis3D_SPARC, Emis3D_JET, Emis3D_DIII-D, etc)
